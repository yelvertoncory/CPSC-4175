## HW 5

1. The two ways to design a product are operation-oriented design and data-oriented design. Operation focuses on operations where data-oriented where the processes conform to the data.
2. I'm assuming design workflow equates to data flow analysis. A data flow diagram is the input to the data flow analysis. These are important because it shows what input comes in, what happens to those inputs as data, and where they end up as outputs. The output is important because you can locate the first point in the data flow where output can identified as different than internal data. Then you can break down each part of the data flow further and further until you identify unique operations needed to be performed.
3. I would put course list as the input variable because it is the requirement to graduate without any operation performed. I would put grades made during the semester as processing variables. The output variable would be the sections completed on your advising record this is because you have to complete the section for this to happen.
4.  List courses, determine passing grade, make as successful if passing grade is true.
5. I would create student class. I could create a String name, String major, and boolean variables for each section title. I could create  getters and setters for each variable, as well as a constructor.
6.  Not really sure what my options are with this question. I tend to think our project is an four phase iteration driven development with analysis, design, implementation, and testing. Now, we do development things previously done and create new things if that helps answer your question.
7. Testing implementation involves ignoring specifications and just testing the code. To do this you have to test every possible option for the code. Testing for the specifications ignores the code and just looks at  what the outputs are vs what the specifications require.
8. Using the formula M = N - N + 2p. M = 11 - 10  + 2(11) = 23.
9. I've read a little online about these and they seem to just be a tool that is more guided in making design diagrams than just a diagramming tool.
10. I think the article does a good job of showing the importance of software before it says how primitive our style of development is. I think the professors critique of a CS degree is apt as I often agree. I disagree strongly with the articles claim that to write good software you have to be run like an accounting firm and less like a "Microserf place". It sounds like a grumpy old man who doesn't like a workplace that is different than what they are use too. I like the emphasis on team and lack of ego's, but I don't think you have to do away with a "fun" work culture. I'll also speak to the first point in the process with a little bit about myself. I've worked as a BA intern twice, but I am a CS major. I primarily did non coding things, but I stress all semester about coding things. I've heard it said that having a technical background makes you more attractive as a BA, but as you know a lot of what you do is defined by nontechichnial people. The idea of writing pseudocode as requirements sounds promising, but I would imagine the requirements document is a bulky overdone piece of paper. I want to trim everything down to what is needed as defined by the development team to do their job. The balance that a normal developer would have is time and more importantly the value of time. 2500 pages for one page wouldn't fly at a TSYS, but it makes sense on a multi billion dollar life or death operation like in the article. I think that is important.
