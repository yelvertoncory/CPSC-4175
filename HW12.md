## HW 12

1. An aspect is more of a class diagram instead of a solo class. It is a unit of code supporting a similar goal.
2. The analysis phase would lend itself more to a GUI being mobile friendly. The design phase would begin to interact with components unique to mobile devices such as memory constraints.
3. The approach to solving this problem is using a shared API across devices at an operating system level.
4. VS promotes component based design by encouraging reusing names or methods instead of creating your own. The weakness is obviously the developer can get dependent on it.
5. SAAS is where a third-party host applications for customers over the internet, IaaS is virtualized computing resources over internet, PaaS is when a third-party provides hardware adn software to users over internet. They are all cloud computing related. The difference is the committment of the third party.
6.
7. One technique is obfuscation. It promotes security by making the software not readable to humans so they can't reverse engineer it. An example would be a game using obfuscation in it's source code in beta so people couldn't data mine and spoil the game for others.
8. I agree that the goal should be to allow for external and internal changes when it comes to the data internally. The relational view strenghs respond well with this goal. You can exist separately from machine purposes and be independent among programs. I agree with making data unique as to not overlap effort and most redudancy can be accomplished through views instead of new tables.
