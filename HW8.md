1. You need to analyze what the steps in a methodology are trying to accomplish and incorporate them into your proces as it fits your needs.
2. I believe it is a true statement. I don't believe there are any noticeable differences - you still have different phases, you still loop, and you have a defined group of work.
3. Requirements Workflow - determine clients needs. Analysis Workflow - analyze and refine requirements to understand requirements. Design Workflow - refine artifacts of analysis workflow in a workable implemetation. Implementation workflow - implement the project. Test workflow - test artifacts depending on workflow.
4. The software project management plan is more concerned with budget and time constraints, and the software development process is reactive way to meet those concderns for developers. I do not think a software project management plan can replace a process because quality isn't at the forefronk of a project management plan.
5. I don't suppose I get the difference here. The testing workflow can be summarized by saying the following workflow must all be traceable to the workflow before it, and you test the quality of hte one before it by ensuring this relationship. I suppose the workflow artifacts are concerned with this as a priority, but they must concern themselves with this to pass testing. I do not feel it is an inconsistency.
6. You define postdelivery maintenance in a few different types of severity and time estimates, and create a comfortable promise of work to the client that ensures you are fixing what you have already delivered and meeting current new needs. The developers must be flexible.
7. I do not think they are mutually exclusive. You can name the phases in the process whatever you want, but if you are achieving the same goals they are just rebranding the same thing. The 3.10 diagram clearly shows the different workflows have different stages of focus in the unified process. I would say they are mutually supportive.
8. I believe they are different because a group of small waterfall phases will yield a different result than one waterfall phase. I also think the diagram in B has a business focus as well.
9. Software development is just postdelivery maintence. You are improving existing code. Software process improvement concerns the actions taken from the client to the testing phase and it is very important. I would argue focusing on software process improvement ensures you get happy programmers and happy clients.
