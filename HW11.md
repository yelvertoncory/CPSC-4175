## HW 11

1. Stepwise refinement is like deciding on what your dream vacation is if cost wasn't a factor then trying to determine the duration and how you will fund it later.
2. One major difference with OOAD is that it is concerned with the lowest level of the program. You begin to think with how different components interact at the beginning.
3. I agree on the notion that I have the idea that programming comes with mastering a language. That has diminished a bit as I have learned more about techniques and dabbled into multiple languages. I also partially agree with the idea it is just the decision to what examples you use to teach with. I think how they are taught, and the assurance the students are being taught and not tested that makes the difference.
4. Due diligence in opening a new product line would be learning what the competitors are for that product and research any copyright concerns before developing your own version.
5. This is an example of bad coupling. A good example would be adding the method of object B into object A, or giving Object B the flexility you wouldn't need object A.
6. I don't even know where to start here.
7. //This executes file edit which depends on all the following files
  edit : main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
       insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
        cc -o edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
                   insert.o search.o files.o utils.o
//these files are the ones that main.o depends on. It executes the file and calls the dependent files after. Not sure line by line is needed. 
main.o : main.c defs.h
        cc -c main.c
kbd.o : kbd.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c kbd.c
command.o : command.c defs.h command.h
        cc -c command.c
display.o : display.c defs.h buffer.h
        cc -c display.c

        cc -c insert.c

        cc -c files.c
utils.o : utils.c defs.h
        cc -c utils.c
clean :
        rm edit main.o kbd.o command.o display.o \
