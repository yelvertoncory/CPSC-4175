1. Human "error".  I think there is a maturing of less and less time spent creating documents and planning and more time implementing. An inexperienced team has great value going through all 5 steps in detail, but a veteran group will likely combine phases into something of a hybrid.
2. Waterfall is iterative because it tries to do all analysis, requirements, and implementations known, while incremental would imply it does the top requirements, then the next set and so forth.
3. I do this with school all the time as I would imagine most students do. I would say the result is mixed. I never feel relaxed and like I have a break because I always feel like my mind is on the next thing. The result is burnt out every semester.
4. The test workflow shouldn't begin in increment A because you shouldn't be afraid to be creative and bold in your decisions when you have time to spare. By testing early you can encourage the silence of these ideas because people think of what will pass test more than what will be a good product. Requirements should always be done because I would think you would be adding requirements when you think of new features.
5.  I would say you think of the different chunks of effort you want in your project and focus on the most independent chunk first. This would be incremental. The iterative portion comes in when every four weeks we focus on fine tuning the previous chunk and now we add the next set of features.
6. No, I don't. I think if you have documentation for one piece of functionality then you can move on with further steps in the process for that functionality. If it were true I suppose we would have done all the requirements and design we could think of before we wrote any code.
7. Agile does two things I really love. The first thing is the leadership that comes from the bottom upwards. The developers get to determine the stories and assigns them a time estimate. Then you have members of the team whose job it is to limit the obstacles, like meetings, that would hinder development. In Scrum this would be the Scrum Master. I also like how Agile allows the software process to be story centric, and work can continue to flow before everything is finished.
