## HW 10

1. I'm going to wager the two types of planning are cost estimates and duration estimates. Cost estimate would entail the cost of the supporting systems for the project. It also includes the labor cost for the people needed to support the project. Duration estimates would deal with how long something would take to complete. Another would be how long the contract would be.
2. Figure 9.1 details how precise of an estimate of cost that can be done at various stages of development. The ranges go from 0.25 million to 4 million in requirements down to 1 million during implementation.
3. The two type of costs are internal and external cost. Internal cost include salaries of developers and cost of hardware to support the product. External cost include the price the customer pays for the product and the price the customer pays for speed.
4. Creation of source code is a small part of the total effort - if you spend 5% writing code and the other 95% in meetings you still have to pay for the same amount of hours. Implementing the same product in two different languages results in different lines of code - Java would take up more lines than Python. It is often unclear exactly how to count lines of code - some people space after each keyword in a SQL statement, others don't. Not all the code implemented is delivered to the client - the obvious one here is most of the code in Visual Studio isn't used.
5. Function Point Analysis was designed in 1970. It is a response to the problem with estimating software size by units of code. It seeks to give a size independent of technology or system. I would say there is a pretty standard idea of what FPA is. Different groups can break it into different nomenclatures or techniques for them, but the general  idea of not using lines of code to estimate size is pretty well adopted.
6.  I've selected the Project context section. It is primarily concerned with the life cycle process. It states you should plan to periodically assess the project with the intention of finding improvements during development. It suggest that you should always include infrastruure concerns. It also states you should plan for gaining acceptance for users in your plan.
7. I would development with documentation in mind for my project. I would try to do low effort task like code commenting as I code. I disagree strongly on spending 1.5 hours documenting that you spend 1 hour coding. Agile itself is pretty anti-documentation so I'm sure the ratio is much more in codings favor. We have to do the documenting after we do our project so that will be a pain. If I could go back I would avoid this.
8. Because users aren't likely to look at the code. Without documentation they could believe you didn't tailor something to them. You could very well be copying and pasting something for someone else.
