1. A software requirements specification must contain what the product must do, and the constraints involved.
2. _example requirement:_ When you click a button it displays the total. The ambiguity here happens with the pronouns. A button doesn't designate what button should display the total. It doesn't display exactly what should display the total. It also doesn't give any constraints.
3. In this simple data flow diagram the professor enters the grades into Cougarview, which the student verifies, and at the end the grades are uploaded on the Academic Transcript.
4. So the cart has two states: empty or not empty. The way to transition from empty to not empty is to add items to the shopping cart. The way to return back to empty is to either checkout or to remove the items.
5. In my diagram the data in the customer database engages with the data in the product database by way of purchasing a product. When this is done both identification information from the customer and the product is placed into the orders table.
6. In my diagram I break out the phases of the product as I see them. I display the inputs to that portion of the process, and the outputs from the phase of the process.
7. My SDL diagram shows that the user provides either text or an image file to the front end of our project. After that the information is stored to the database, and a link is created for the user.
8. So this function adds a Birthday to the Birthday Book table. Above the line it takes a name and data as inputs. After the line it checks to see if the name is known, and then computes the birthday as name plus date.
